**This project is under initial development.**

The game is written in Python but it depends on following libs:
  * pyglet for windowing / OpenGL framework.
  * pyeuclid for vectors and matrices.
  * pybullet forked (2011-09-15 version) and heavily extended (I plan to send my work to the author soon as I update documentation).
  * Faster OBJ, by Christopher Night in order to load OBJ models.
  * The models are modeled in Blender and exported as Wavefront OBJ.

If you like to get involved or just play the game in order to help you get started check [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/pybilliard/w/list) pages. <br>

In this video you can see the current state of game with proxy graphics (which is used for physic bodies).<br>
Here I'm trying to play carom game, but not so successful ;-)<br>
As you can see in the video the aiming and shooting as well as view control is all done with mouse. The keyboard controls are used only to switch between different views, shooting and adding spin to the cue ball. <br>
