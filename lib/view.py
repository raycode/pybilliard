        The view transformation transforms vertices into eye coordinates and is the inverse of a
        transformation to place and orient the viewer in world coordinates. The view transformation has
        two components: a 4 x 4 orientation matrix, O, and a 4 x 4 translation matrix, T.
        The view transformation matrix, V, is the concatenation of the two 4 x 4 matrices:
        V = O*T
        The orientation matrix O is an orthonormal basis derived from the view direction and up
        vectors. Given an [x y z] view direction d and an [x y z] up vector u, compute their cross
        product c as:
        c = d x u
        Discard u and compute the actual up vector U as:
        U = c x d
        Normalize d, c, and u' to unit length, and create the orientation matrix O as follows:
